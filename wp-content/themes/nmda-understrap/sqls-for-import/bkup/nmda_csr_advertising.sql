Unlike standard brand advertising, this campaign combines experiential marketing with hyper-targeted digital support (e.g., Instacart ads tied to specific stores during roasting weekends).

We do not have private funds allocated for this type of infrastructure, and the grant would enable us to invest in a high-quality, durable setup that enhances our presence at public events and on our farm.\n\nThe project involves the purchase of customizable pop-up tents that will feature our custom logo and branding. These tents will be used at all our events to create a professional and cohesive appearance, improve functionality, and strengthen brand recognition in the community.\n\nWe will use the tents to prominently display our “Taste the Tradition” and “Grown with Tradition” logos at a wide range of events. We currently attend three large farmers markets weekly—Downtown Growers’ Market, Uptown Winrock Market, and the Railyards Market—as well as other major community events, including Earth Day Festival, Lavender Festival, Balloon Fiesta, ristra demonstrations at the Albuquerque Tramway during Balloon Fiesta, Summer Fest, Spring Festival at the Rio Grande Nature Center, and many more.\n\nIn addition, the tents will be used at our farm, which is open six months out of the year and draws thousands of visitors each season. We host large events during the fall and holiday seasons, and the tents will be used consistently throughout our open season for workshops, classes, field trips, and much more. The tents will also serve as the backdrop for live musicians who perform at our events, creating a lively atmosphere and offering photo opportunities that are shared widely on social media. They will also be used weekly by our chef for food preparation during our farm-to-table dinners. The tents will serve as both a functional asset and a powerful promotional tool across all our public engagements.','This advertising effort differs from more routine advertising because it integrates the collaboration of our brand with yours—\"Taste the Tradition\" and \"Grown with Tradition\"—directly into our physical presence at community events, markets, and our farm. Unlike traditional advertising, which often relies on digital or print media, this initiative involves customizable pop-up tents that prominently display our combined logos and messaging in real-time, creating a tangible and interactive experience for attendees.  By utilizing the tents at diverse events—including farmers markets, festivals, and farm events—we engage directly with our audience, offering a more immersive and memorable connection. Additionally, our tents will serve as backdrops for live music performances and photo opportunities, encouraging social media sharing and organic promotion. This approach not only amplifies our visibility but also positions us as an active part of the local community.  Furthermore, unlike routine advertising efforts that may be passive or limited to certain channels, this approach has a consistent, physical presence at multiple touchpoints across the entire city, promoting the collaboration of our brand and yours to both locals and visitors. Our activities attract many tourists, especially those visiting for events like the Balloon Fiesta, and our farm has become a tourist destination in itself. The reach of this initiative will extend far beyond the local community, engaging not only Albuquerque residents but also global visitors who come to experience the rich cultural and agricultural activities we offer. This citywide and even international presence helps to position our collaboration on a broader scale, reaching a diverse and global audience.','Local Families and Residents: People living in Albuquerque and surrounding areas who enjoy local markets, farm-to-table experiences, and family-friendly activities like workshops, festivals, and seasonal events at your farm.  Tourists and Visitors: Individuals visiting Albuquerque, particularly during high-profile events like the Balloon Fiesta, who are looking to experience local culture, agriculture, and community events. Your farm is a destination for tourists who want to experience traditional farming, local foods, and unique cultural activities.  Food Enthusiasts and Culinary Tourists: Those interested in sustainable agriculture, local food production, and culinary experiences like farm-to-table dinners. This group may include food lovers, chefs, and people passionate about locally sourced ingredients.  Event-Goers and Festival Attendees: Attendees of events such as the Earth Day Festival, Lavender Festival, Summer Fest, and Spring Festival who are looking for unique experiences and local products. Your tents at these events serve as an opportunity to interact with these festival-goers and create lasting impressions.  Cultural and Agricultural Enthusiasts: Individuals interested in learning more about traditional farming practices and the heritage of New Mexico, particularly those who enjoy hands-on experiences, field trips, and educational workshops.  Social Media Savvy Individuals: People who enjoy sharing photos and experiences on social media, especially at events with live music, unique backdrops, and vibrant community activities. This group helps to spread brand awareness organically through their online presence.  Eco-Conscious Consumers: Those who are passionate about sustainability, locally grown food, and supporting small businesses that promote environmental responsibility and community engagement.','The advertising impact will last as long as the tents are in use, typically 3 to 5 years if well maintained. The tents will be consistently visible at our events and farm activities, ensuring ongoing exposure throughout this period.','The expected reach and impressions of this advertising effort are substantial, as the tents will be used consistently at high-traffic events such as three weekly farmers markets, major festivals like the Balloon Fiesta, and seasonal activities at our farm, which draws thousands of visitors annually.  Each event attracts hundreds to thousands of attendees, including both local residents and out-of-town visitors. With the tents prominently displaying our branding, we anticipate reaching thousands of individuals each season, with additional exposure through social media as attendees share photos featuring the tents. Over the 3 to 5-year lifespan of the tents, the total reach will extend well into the hundreds of thousands, both through direct interaction at events and through online impressions.','(1) 10x 20 $585 + tax \n(1) 10x 15 $298 + tax\n(3) 10x10 $235 X 3 +tax\nTotal $1588\n',1,0,'SP','2025-05-14 23:04:17','2025-08-04 21:05:27',NULL,'14ac0ba4-96d4-4dea-abe3-721c5395b0ae','6dc3ed64-6a52-4140-9e40-e9644df26983'),('b79a1a24-9371-4bce-8843-298aa4a15e36','3c3cc286-f6dd-4846-8529-ce8983e7c4e6','Snugglecubs Cookies','Suzanne','Slauson','505-347-3591','contact@snugglecubscookies.com','11024 Montgomery Blvd NE PMB #143','Albuquerque','NM','87111','11024 Montgomery Blvd NE PMB #143','Albuquerque','NM','87111','Other','Banner','Uprinting.com (printer)','New banner highlights Taste the Tradition logo on our new 4x10\' banner that we use for events.','This is a primary form of advertising for our small business.','All attendees of specific events','When in use at vending events','3-10k per event','$103.01 for banner creation',1,0,'DS','2024-06-09 21:08:10','2024-06-17 19:07:46',NULL,'8d679435-29d1-4787-8128-0e207765b373','2864f093-429f-4fcf-b1c0-ae001d8c9297'),('baf3fcfc-9e23-4366-99d3-e6af95b7cd51','446af306-6228-4485-85d9-0e39a3507634','Cibolo Junction Food & Spice Co.

We believe this new marketing campaign will make a significant improvement in our reach in New Mexico. ','This guerrilla marketing campaign using t-shirts and hats is a more unconventional, community-focused approach compared to traditional advertising methods. Unlike routine advertising efforts such as print ads, digital ads, or billboards, this strategy directly engages the local community by using wearable, branded items that people can use and display in their daily lives. It creates an opportunity for organic, word-of-mouth promotion, allowing the community to be a walking advertisement. The goal is to build a more personal, lasting connection with the New Mexico community, making our brand part of their lifestyle rather than just something they see in an ad. This campaign stands out because it emphasizes grassroots engagement and personal connection, creating a more authentic and memorable experience for the target audience.  ','Outdoor Enthusiasts: People who enjoy hiking, camping, skiing, and other outdoor activities in New Mexico’s diverse landscapes.  Environmental Advocates: Community members who prioritize sustainable practices, land stewardship, and ecological conservation.  Local Small Business Supporters: Consumers who are passionate about supporting local businesses and fostering a sense of community.  By using t-shirts and hats, the campaign also aims to reach a broader audience through everyday visibility in local stores, farmers\' markets, outdoor events, and casual settings, making the brand part of their lifestyle and helping to build organic word-of-mouth promotion.','The guerrilla marketing campaign will place t-shirts and hats in locations where they will reach our target audience in New Mexico. Specifically, the campaign will target high-traffic areas and community events where outdoor enthusiasts, ranchers, and environmental advocates are likely to be present.  Farmers\' Markets: Distribute branded items at local farmers\' markets to engage with those interested in sustainable agriculture and local goods. Community Events and Festivals: Distribute branded items at outdoor festivals, agricultural fairs, or ranching-related events where people from the community gather. Timing: Launch Period: The campaign will kick off in the summer months (June-August), taking advantage of peak outdoor activity and event seasons. Sustained Visibility: The distribution of t-shirts and hats will continue through fall (September-November) to maintain visibility during fall and outdoor events like fairs and festivals. Event Specific: Additional placements will align with specific local events or festivals throughout the year to maintain engagement and fresh brand exposure. By targeting these locations and timing the distribution around seasonal peaks, we will maximize the visibility of the campaign and reach the right audience at the right time.','The expected reach and impressions for this guerrilla marketing campaign will be driven by the strategic placement of t-shirts and hats in high-traffic, community-centric areas. Given the nature of the campaign, the reach will be more organic and word-of-mouth driven compared to traditional advertising. Here’s an estimate of the potential reach: Farmers\' Markets: These markets typically attract a few hundred to a thousand visitors each week, depending on the size of the market. If we distribute 200-300 shirts and hats over the course of several weeks, we could expect to engage at least 2,000-3,000 individuals, with many likely to share the brand name with friends and family. Community Events and Festivals: Local events can have a significant impact. Events like agricultural fairs or festivals typically draw anywhere from 500 to 5,000 attendees. Distributing t-shirts and hats at 3-4 major events could lead to 3,000-10,000 impressions, particularly as people wear the items in public. Overall Estimate: The campaign could reach approximately 8,000-20,000 individuals directly through item distribution and generate several times more impressions through word-of-mouth as people wear the t-shirts and hats in their daily activities. These impressions could grow further if the campaign garners social media attention, with people posting photos of themselves in the gear, further amplifying the reach.','We would like to pair this guerilla campaign with meta ad campaign that drives traffic to our website.  We are just beginning to pursue a social media ad campaign and believe pairing it with these tshirts and hats will have a significant impact on our reach.   COST BREAKDOWN\n1.
